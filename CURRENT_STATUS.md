# Current Status - Property Rooms Issue

## Problem Summary
The property creation API was failing because the database table `properties` doesn't have a `rooms` column, but the frontend was sending `rooms` data and the Property model was trying to save it.

## Current Fix Applied

### 1. Temporarily Commented Out Rooms Column in Model
- Commented out the `rooms` column definition in `src/properties/property.model.ts`
- This prevents Sequelize from trying to insert into a non-existent column

### 2. Updated Service to Handle Rooms Data
- Modified `create()` method to exclude `rooms` from database insert but include it in response
- Modified `findOne()` method to add `rooms` data to the response for frontend compatibility
- The rooms data is now handled in memory but not persisted to database

### 3. Created Test Script
- `test-simple-property.js` - Tests the current fix with simple property data

## Current Behavior
✅ **Property creation works** - No more database column errors  
✅ **Rooms data appears in response** - Frontend gets the rooms data it expects  
❌ **Rooms data is not persisted** - Data is lost when application restarts  

## Next Steps to Complete the Fix

### Option 1: Add Rooms Column to Database (Recommended)
1. **Connect to your PostgreSQL database** using any client (pgAdmin, psql, etc.)
2. **Run this SQL command**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE properties ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "rooms" JSON;
   ```
3. **Uncomment the rooms column** in `src/properties/property.model.ts`
4. **Update the service** to save rooms data to database
5. **Test with** `node test-simple-property.js`

### Option 2: Use the Simple SQL Script
1. **Run the provided script**: `add-rooms-column.sql`
2. **Follow the same steps** as Option 1

### Option 3: Update Database Credentials and Run Migration
1. **Update database credentials** in `run-migration.js`
2. **Run**: `node run-migration.js`
3. **Follow the same steps** as Option 1

## Files Modified
- `src/properties/property.model.ts` - Commented out rooms column
- `src/properties/properties.service.ts` - Updated create and findOne methods
- `add-rooms-column.sql` - Simple SQL script to add rooms column
- `test-simple-property.js` - Test script for current fix

## Files Created
- `database-migration.sql` - Full migration script (not used yet)
- `run-migration.js` - Migration runner (needs correct credentials)
- `DATABASE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed instructions

## Testing
Run the test to verify the current fix works:
```bash
node test-simple-property.js
```

This should create a property successfully and show the rooms data in the response, even though it's not persisted to the database yet.
